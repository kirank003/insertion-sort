Start with the first element.
Compare the current element with the next element.
If the current element is greater than the next element, then swap both the elements. If not, move to the next element.
Repeat steps 1 â€“ 3 until we get the sorted list. To better understand bubble sort, recall the list that contains the elements 5, 3, 4, 2 initially.

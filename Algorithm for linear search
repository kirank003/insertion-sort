Start from the first element of the array.
Compare the target value with the current element.
If the current element matches the target, return the index of the current element.
If the current element doesn't match the target, move to the next element in the array.
Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the target is found or until the end of the array is reached.
If the target is not found in the array, return a special value (e.g., -1) to indicate that it's not present.
